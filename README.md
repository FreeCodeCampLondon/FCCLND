Freecodecamp portal for Londoners campers

Hey guys, I have been starting developing our portal. The aim of this site is keeping track of people working at Freecodecamp track in London in order to have an easy tools to keep in touch with each other, meet new people and track at which point of the FCC track others are..so we can connect easily with others are at the same point of the track if we are willing to pair programming.

It's supposed to  be newbie frindly to permit everyone to contribute.Therefore  it's slighly over commented, but I'm sure you with me if everyone can give a contribute to it. :)

There will be issues to resolve using: CSS , HTML, JS, Gulp, Unit Test and in the future I'd like to migrate from Firebase to MongoDB - probably MongoLab- using NodeJs and ExpressJS to develop our litte CMS.
